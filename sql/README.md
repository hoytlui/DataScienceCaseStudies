# Objective
Using MySQL, PHPMyAdmin, Juptyer Notebook, and SQLite to tackle a series of challenges on a database containing information about a country club.

### Procedure
First, work around in the PHPMyAdmin interface. Then, connect to a local instance of the database using Python and SQLite, and retrieve particular pieces of information and translate requests into SQL queries. 

For examples,

Q5. Produce a list of facilities, with each labelled as 'cheap' or 'expensive', depending on if their monthly maintenance cost is more than $100.
Return the name and monthly maintenance of the facilities.

Q8. Produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which will cost the member (or guest) more than $30.
Remember that guests have different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and the guest user's ID is always 0.
