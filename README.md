# Data Science Case Studies
This repository contains all case studies completed during the Springboard Data Science Career Track Bootcamp.

These fundamental projects (sorted by newest to oldest) do pave the way for my data science journey with further in-depth study and exploration.
Many new ideas and skills evolved when I queried to solve the problems, which formed a solid foundation for my problem-solving process.
