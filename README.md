# Data Science Case Studies
This repository contains all case studies and projects completed during the Springboard Data Science Career Track Bootcamp.

As true as the learning doesn't stop here, these fundamental projects do pave the way for my data science journey with further in-depth study and exploration. Many new ideas and skills evolved when I queried to solve the problems. Feel free to witness my growth in these projects, as well as the ones in the other repositories that will keep updating in the future.
