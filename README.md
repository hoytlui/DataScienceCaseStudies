# Data Science Case Studies
This repository contains all case studies completed during the Springboard Data Science Career Track Bootcamp.

As true as the learning doesn't stop here, these fundamental projects (sorted by newest to oldest) do pave the way for my data science journey with further in-depth study and exploration. Many new ideas and skills evolved when I queried to solve the problems. Feel free to witness my growth with these projects, as well as the ones in the other repositories that will keep updating in the future.

[Red wine quality - linear regression (ordinary least squares)](https://github.com/hoytlui/DataScienceCaseStudies/tree/main/linear_regression_ordinary_least_squares)
implemented linear regression (particularly ordinary least squares) analysis to predict red wine acidity

[Integrating apps - permutation test](https://github.com/hoytlui/DataScienceCaseStudies/tree/main/permutation_test)
applied permutation test to conclude whether apps uploaded to Google Play Store have higher ratings than to Apple Store

[Medical charges - frequentist statistics](https://github.com/hoytlui/DataScienceCaseStudies/tree/main/frequentist_inference)
applied frequentist inference on theoretical and real-world problems

[Country club - SQL](https://github.com/hoytlui/DataScienceCaseStudies/tree/main/sql)
queried an external MySQL database to answer business questions

[London pricing - manipulating dataframe](https://github.com/hoytlui/DataScienceCaseStudies/blob/main/Manipulating_dataframe/)
tested on data manipulation and basic visualization skills
