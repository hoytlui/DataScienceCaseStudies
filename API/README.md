# Objective
- To pull data from the Quandl API and analyze it



#### Analysis:
There are many ways to handle the json data in Python. For me, I found the easiest way is to use pandas.

Once we have the data in json format, we can convert it into columns and data and fit into a dataframe for mathematical computation.


#### Conclusion:
This few lines code using simple pandas method saves time that can be spent on analysis.
